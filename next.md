takeout:
  - customizable createTheme()
  - cli: 
    - tamagui generate
      - JSDocs / TSMorph
    - tamagui serve
      - able to focus in on any component without needing to restart anything
      - localhost:3000/FuzzyComponentName
    - tamagui test ./packages/site/components/OffsetBox.tsx
    - tamagui debug ./packages/site/components/OffsetBox.tsx
  - ios/android specific themes
  - basic styled() extraction to css at compile time
  - compiler hot reload
  - VSCode
    - move from functional component to styled() and back
    - built in jsx => css converter
    - "move to my design system" (finds tamagui package.json and moves there)
      - grab a selection of any styled() or functional component
      - moves it into your design system
      - updates index.ts there
      - updates imports in app
  - <Combobox /> (<SelectInput /> or <InputSelect />)
  - <Scale />
  - List hierarchical (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list)

- ornaments system:
    - hooks inside any styled component to add decoration-only elements
      - for example to mimic iOS style ListItem you want a separator
      - themes should ideally define this, right? 
        - or themes can export decorations

so:

```tsx
import { ornaments, themes } from '@tamagui/theme-ios'

export const createTamagui({
  ornaments,
  themes
})

// could enforce it only accepts TamaguiComponents:
const ListItemSeparator = styled(Stack, {})
const ornaments = {
  ListItem: [ListItemSeparator],
}

//  could make it accept platform specific object
const ornaments = {
  ListItem: {
    ios: [ListItemSeparator],
    web: []
  },
}
```

- next css shaker 
  - loads every page after build and finds all unused styles, produces minimal css
- <List.Section /> see (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list Section)
- compiler could insert special props like:
  - __noAnimations, __noTheme, __noSpace
  - it would change key={} alongside that
  - that way HMR still works, but loads less hooks
  - works in production for extra perf
- as={} + extraction + types
- <GradientText /> can work native with 
  - https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view
- react-native-skia / svg image support
- beforeStyle, afterStyle could work ...
  - only if we can do with psuedos:
    - focusStyle={{ after: { fullscreen: true, border... } }}
    - allows for proper focused borders that don't require super hacks
    - see Switch
- styled(Button) types break   
- <Avatar />
  - radio may be List.Radio just combines List, Label, Drawer
    - can use Switch or check or custom
- <Accordion />
- <Carousel />
- load theme hook via feature if possible
- styleq / react-native-web 18 exploration
- <Video />, <Spinner />
- instead of generating classname strings generate objects
  - instead of concatClassNames then just object ...
- fix memory leak causing OOM eventually on site
- // this can be done with CSS entirely right?
- optional 18-only separate releases? beta.3.react18?
  - react native doesn't support it yet except on new arch
  - (useId/useInsertionEffect)
- escape hatch for html props `htmlProps` or tag={} => as={} + work better?
- whenever switch over to styleq or own internal css generator:
  - remove getStylesAtomic altogether - loop only once over props/styles
- exported hooks - useControllableState, useLayout
- <SizableFrame />, <EnsureFlexed />
- document/release <ThemeReverse />
- container queries
- <Menu />
- <PopoverDrawer /> + <MenuDrawer />
- // TODO only on hoverable/pressable!
- options to render to native components in more places
- <Group />
- transformOrigin
  - may be able to translate to matrix https://www.jianshu.com/p/c67559b8f691
  - https://github.com/sueLan/react-native-anchor-point
- space => gap (blocked https://github.com/facebook/yoga/pull/1116)
- Text selectColor
- focusWithinStyle
- accessibility upgrades (focus rings etc)
- colored cli output
- have tamagui watch the tamagui.config.ts file and report if types break
- smart responsive scaling system (<Scale /> basically)
- https://github.com/react-native-menu/menu
- vscode plugin to highlight the current node your cursors inside of in dom
- blur prop built in ?



### Skeleton

- I think we ultimately need a new prop for all tamagui components skeleton, if true it will render the component as-is, but add an overlay view (SkeletonOverlay) that covers it with some default style, plus should set various things like pointerevents and aria-disabled

- skeleton prop can also accept any react element, so you can do <Button skeleton={<MyCustomSkeleton />} and maybe that even receives some special prop that gives info on the Button to skeleton

- we can add a defaultSkeleton to createTamagui so you can control that out of the box (defaults to SkeletonOverlay)

- been wanting to add this to tamagui since forever but its a good use case here: we can add a  new option defaultProps to createTamagui, so you can do defaultProps: { Button: { skeleton: <SomeSpecialOneJustForButton /> } } which may be useful for if certain components have different needs

- may eventually want something like skeletonStyle which only applies to the parent component when skeleton is on, this probably is necessary so you can do things like overflow: hidden; position: relative when skeletons are on, so they fit inside nicely and shadows dont overlap

- a nice wrapper component <Skeleton>{...components}</Skeleton> and it will force all children that support it to have a skeleton, but runs into trouble with fully flattened components... we'd have to limit them to only accept skeletonStyle and not a sub-component i believe, this is my biggest ? right now... maybe nice to limit skeleton to only be style props, because otherwise can get heavy.. 

- when you have Suspense this is a bit weird, but you can do something like <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton><MyLoadingView load={false} /></Skeleton>}><MyLoadingView /></Skeleton>
